# Pond Examples

Some example scripts for [Pond Extended](https://github.com/Hatya-mouse/pond-extended).

Copy the script to your duck, or load 'example_setup' using the 💾load button in the top-left corner of Pond Extended.
Enjoy 😄!

# Scripts

Example duck scripts can be found under `ducks/`.

## `ai_generated/`

Scripts generated by AI. One from ChatGPT, and another one from Perplexity. Very similar to mine somehow.

## `relentless_duck/`

A duck script written by me. Features lead shooting. Beat this if you can.

## `weaker_ducks/`

Dumber scripts written by me, containing legendary **Gomi 1.0 (Garbage 1.0)**. Crush 'em and feel the rush. You may be crushed first though.
